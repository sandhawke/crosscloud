Should this use github issues?   Should this be better organized?   This will do for now.

## Identity: person vs persona vs profile

## How to authenticate to own site?

WebID-TLS?

Other TLS?

IndieAuth?

Just a password?

## Delegated Authentication?

Using Nonce-Loop?

## POST vs PUT

Maybe rel=type ldp:hierarchicalContainer ?

## SPARQL vs LDP for reading

## Patch format being a subset of SPARQL Update

## Index of users ('webizen')

## Index of pod providers, pod provider certification

## Subdomain portability, relocation sites, floating linked data

## Granularity
    
issue tracker = one graph, or each person does their thing

## Social Merge

what to do when people post conflicting facts

## Apps invading privacy (caged, beneficent)

## Giving people data with strings attached (delete-after, acceptable use)

## Vocabulary evolution and maintenance

## App identity (grant permission and allow undo on a per-code-version basis)
