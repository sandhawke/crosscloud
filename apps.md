# Possible Crosscloud Application Areas

Anywhere there is multiuser software, there is some demand for crosscloud software.  So what kinds of multiuser software exists?   Here are some categories, with a few examples of each.   In time, it would be good to see multiple crosscloud offerings in each category.  This might be a disruptive upstart, or it might one or more vendor in the space adds crosscloud functionality.

To do: 

- add analysis about the technical issue for crosscloud versions
- add analysis about business issues for crosscloud versions
- add more links to crunchbase and wikipedia
- validate against other software product classification schemes
- link to existing or under-development crosscloud software

## Consumer-to-Consumer Sales

Alice has an item or a service to sell to Bob.  How does she let Bob know about this?  Can she trust him?  Can he trust her?  What price should she set?  What price should he offer?

Examples:

- eBay (1995)
- craigslist (1995)

Crosscloud considerations:

- eBay has a particularly strong hold, since one cannot auction an item on two separate sites at once.   At this point it is also very well known and trusted.
- There may be untapped opportunities for innovation, particularly with lightweight and mobile apps.
- There may be buyers and sellers unable to use eBay, wanting something more like a cash transaction in their own country
- The fact that eBay and craigslist both exist suggests they are each vulnerable.  In general craigslist involves human communication, often face-to-face, to establish trust, while eBay encourages trust by making certain guarantees to the parties.
- eBay supports faceted search for some kinds of products (eg [ipods](http://www.ebay.com/electronics/ipod)), but crosscloud apps could potentially bring uniform product details to every niche market
- Establishing trust might be hard, but leveraging social networks (which didn't exist when eBay started) could help.  

## eCommerce Stores

- Amazon zShops (now Marketplace) (1999)

## Crowdsourced Data

Lots of people know something about (some topic), and other people want to know it.  Let folks see it, edit it, improve it.
